# Book-Hub-

**PROBLEM DEFINITION**: The Book Hub is the limited options and inconvenience faced by users when searching for and purchasing books online. Current platforms often lack integration with multiple sources, restricting inventory. The Book Hub addresses this by providing a system where users can easily search for books by author or genre, and place orders while accessing an expanded range of inventory through integration with external online bookstores, enhancing the user experience.
